## Use Cases

### USE CASE 1: CATALOGUE/ADD A BOOK TO LIBRARY
**The user wants to catalogue/add a book to their library collection.**

The **Cataloguing and Data Entry** feature is a core functionality of the app that simplifies the process of adding books to the library. It offers three methods for cataloguing:

1. **Manual Entry**: Users can manually enter book details by filling in all required fields.
2. **ISBN Recognition**: Users can scan the barcode using their device's camera or manually enter the ISBN to auto-fill book details.
3. **Search and Add**: Users can search for a book by title, author, or ISBN, and add it to their collection.

The system is integrated with a book database, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. When the ISBN is scanned or entered, relevant book information is automatically populated from the database, making cataloguing quick and convenient.

---

### USE CASE 2: ORGANISE AND MANAGE BOOKS
**The user wants to organise and manage the books in their library.**

The **Library Organisation and Management** feature allows users to easily categorize their books by:
- **Location**
- **Tags**
- **Genre**

This helps users quickly locate any book in their collection, making it easier to organize and maintain a comprehensive library.

---

### USE CASE 3: TRACK A BOOK
**The user wants to track a book.**

The **Loan Tracking** feature allows users to keep a record of books they've loaned out. Users can:
- Set start and end dates for loaned books.
- View the current loans for a book.
- Check a summary of all loans, including the number of active loans.

While the initial scope included both loan and borrow tracking, the **borrow tracking** feature was removed due to time constraints.

---

### USE CASE 4: RECOMMEND A BOOK
**The user wants book recommendations.**

The **Recommendation** feature offers generic, random book suggestions. However, due to the random nature of the recommendations, including affiliate links was not feasible. The Google Books API, which powers the recommendations, does not provide the necessary direct links for affiliate integration.

As a result, the ability to include affiliate links was removed from the project scope.

---

### USE CASE 5: WRITE A REVIEW
**The user wants to write a review.**

The **Reviews and Ratings** feature allows users to:
- Write detailed reviews for books.
- Assign star ratings.
- Share these reviews within user groups, making them accessible to others within the same group.

This enhances the community aspect, allowing users to discover books based on group recommendations.

---

### USE CASE 6: CREATE AN ACCOUNT
**The user wants to create an account.**

The **Account Management** feature allows users to create and manage their accounts easily. Key functionalities include:
- Creating private notes about books for personal use.
- Sharing reviews within user groups.

To streamline development, the user registration process was limited to **email and password** only. Third-party authentication methods (e.g., Apple, Google) were removed from the scope to allocate more time to other critical features.

---

### USE CASE 7: MANAGE ACCOUNT
**The user wants to add a person to their library.**

The **User Group** feature lets users create and manage groups, enabling them to share their library with others. Key functionalities include:
- Adding individuals to the group.
- Sharing books, reviews, and recent additions.
- Collaborating with other users to organize and explore the shared library.

This feature is ideal for households or communities who want to share and manage their book collections collectively.

---

### USE CASE 8: ADD BOOKS TO A WISH LIST
**The user wants to add books they want to buy to a Wishlist.**

The **Wishlist** feature allows users to:
- Curate a list of books they want to purchase or borrow in the future.
- Add books from the recommendations to their wishlist, building a personalized list of desired titles.

This feature was moved from a secondary objective to a core objective because it enhances the overall user experience and complements the recommendations feature.

---

### USE CASE 9: VIEW BASIC ANALYTICS
**The user wants to view analytics about their library.**

The **Analytics** feature provides basic insights into the user's library, including:
- Total number of books in their collection.
- Number of user groups they are part of.
- Number of books in their wishlist.
- Number of books currently loaned out.

This feature was originally a secondary objective but was moved to a core objective to provide more valuable insights to the user.
